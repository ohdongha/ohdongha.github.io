Research assistant professor working with [Dassanayake lab.@LSU](https://www.lsugenomics.org/). I study plant comparative genomics, especially for those found in "extreme" environments a.k.a. [extremophytes](https://extremeplants.org/what-is-an-extremophyte/).

# Tools
- [OrthNet](https://github.com/ohdongha/OrthNet)
An attempt to identify co-linearity and ortholog groups, and encode evolutionary histories as the topology of Ortholog Networks (OrthNet), among multiple closely related genomes.
- [Genome toolbox](https://github.com/ohdongha/Genome-Toolbox)
Small python scripts useful for manipulating genome assembly (.fa) and annotation (.gtf) files
- PiP (under construction ...)
An attempt to identify functions and gene sets (e.g. Gene Ontology terms) that underwent lineage(s)-specific modifications in gene expression/regulation among multiple species, by performing Phylogenetically-informed Profiling (PiP) of gene sets.
