Research assistant professor working with [Dassanayake lab.@LSU](https://www.lsugenomics.org/). I study plant comparative genomics, especially for those found in "extreme" environments a.k.a. [extremophytes](https://extremeplants.org/what-is-an-extremophyte/).

## News 

- 2021-11-28: The first draft genome of _Phragmites australis_ (common reed) was published in [_Mol Ecol_](https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.16293) :) Fun collaboration with researchers from Tulane Univ. and USGS. Next: chromosome-level assemblies of both native and invasive (in North America) subspecies and more comparative genomics of _Phragmites_ invasion.
