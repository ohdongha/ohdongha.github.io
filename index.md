Research assistant professor working with [Dassanayake lab.@LSU](https://www.lsugenomics.org/). I study plant comparative genomics, especially for those found in "extreme" environments a.k.a. [extremophytes](https://extremeplants.org/what-is-an-extremophyte/).

## News 
(YYYY-MM-DD)

2021-11-28: The first draft genome of _Phragmites australis_ (common reed) was published in [_Mol Ecol_](https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.16293) :) Fun collaboration with researchers from Tulane Univ. and USGS. Next is chromosome-level assemblies of both native and invasive (in North America) subspecies and more comparative genomics of _Phragmites_ invasion.

## Current interests and fantasies

- How to identify significant (e.g. adaptive) modifications in GRN in recent polyploids (e.g. _Camelina sativa_) in comparison to their diploid relatives. Or is it even doable/useful?
- How to compare GRNs among multiple species effectively, without relying on "reciprocal 1-vs-1 best-hit" ortholog pairs and including all lineage(s)-specific duplicates.
- So-called a "reference genome" is likely a chimera of haplotypes and whatnot, if the source is not only heterogygous but also heterogeneous. Will it be more useful as a reference to allow "wobble" nucleotides (then how about SVs ...)?
- How would the (epi-)genome of a Tolkeinian elf (e.g. Legolas) be different from human? [#ElvenGenomics](https://twitter.com/inspirace/status/1467133537455382532?s=20)?     


## Research
- Comparative genomics of [_Schrenkiella parvula_](https://extremeplants.org/species/schrenkiella-parvula/?ms=halophytes) and [_Eutrema salsugineum_](https://extremeplants.org/species/eutrema-salsugineum/?ms=halophytes), extreme stress-adapted relatives of _Arabidopsis_ and Brassicaceae crops (e.g. Camelina, canola, and other Brassica crops)
- Comparative genomics of [invasive and native _Phragmites australis_ (common reed) in North America](https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/greatlakes/FactSheet.aspx?Species_ID=2937)
- Comparative genomics of seagrass [_Halophila stipulacea_](https://www.gidon-winters.com/research) and its freshwater relative [_Vallisneria americana_](https://plants.ifas.ufl.edu/plant-directory/vallisneria-americana/)
- Developing tools to systemetically detect lineage(s)-specific modifications in gene copy numbers and gene regulatory networks (GRNs)
