Bioinformatics Data Wrangler @ Computercraft; former assistant research professor working with [Dassanayake lab.@LSU](https://www.lsugenomics.org/){:target="_blank"}. I studied plant comparative genomics, especially for those found in "extreme" environments a.k.a. [extremophytes](https://extremeplants.org/what-is-an-extremophyte/){:target="_blank"}.

## News 

- 2022-05-03: Hoping I could assist developing comparative genomics resources for broader scientific community, I moved to Computercraft (see above). Fingers crossed :)

<details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> toggle Archived </summary>
- 2022-05-02: The pandemic-long collaboration, studying a [fascinating innovation in extremophyte root growth strategy under stress](https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/02/world/extreme-plants-stress-climate-scn/index.html){:target="_blank"}, was published in [_Nat Plants_](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41477-022-01139-5){:target="_blank"}. I focused on providing a framework for comparative DAP- and RNA-seq analyses (see [short tweetorial](https://twitter.com/inspirace/status/1525834604351037440){:target="_blank"}).

- 2022-01-10: I presented [Phylogenetically informed Profiling (PiP)](https://github.com/dinnenylab/BrassicaceaeGRN){:target="_blank"}, an attempt to identify functions with lineage(s)-specific GRN modifications, at the "virtual" [Plant & Animal Genome Conference (PAGXXIX)](https://pag.confex.com/pag/xxix/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/43553){:target="_blank"}, Arabidopsis Informatics workshop (see [re-recorded talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zR9b0oKNfiM){:target="_blank"}).

- 2021-11-28: The [first draft genome of _Phragmites australis_ (common reed)](https://genomevolution.org/coge/GenomeInfo.pl?gid=59768){:target="_blank"} was published in [_Mol Ecol_](https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.16293){:target="_blank"} :) Fun collaboration with researchers from Tulane Univ. and USGS. Next: chromosome-level assemblies of both native and invasive (in North America) subspecies and more comparative genomics of _Phragmites_ invasion.
