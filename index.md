Research assistant professor working with [Dassanayake lab.@LSU](https://www.lsugenomics.org/). I study plant comparative genomics, especially for those found in "extreme" environments a.k.a. [extremophytes](https://extremeplants.org/what-is-an-extremophyte/).

# Research
- Comparative genomics of _Schrenkiella parvula_ and _Eutrema salsugineum_, extreme stress-adapted relatives of _Arabidopsis_ and Brassicaceae crops (e.g. Camelina, canola, and other Brassica crops)
- Comparative genomics of invasive and native _Phragmites australis_ (common reed) in North America 
- Comparative genomics of seagrass _Halophila stipulacea_ and its freshwater relative _Vallisneria americana_
- Developing tools to systemetically detect lineage(s)-specific modifications in gene copy numbers and gene regulatory networks (GRNs)

# Tools
- [OrthNet](https://github.com/ohdongha/OrthNet): an attempt to identify co-linearity and ortholog groups, and encode evolutionary histories as the topology of Ortholog Networks (OrthNet), among multiple closely related genomes.
- [Genome toolbox](https://github.com/ohdongha/Genome-Toolbox): small python scripts useful for manipulating genome assembly (.fa) and annotation (.gtf) files
- PiP (under construction): an attempt to identify functions and gene sets (e.g. Gene Ontology terms) that underwent lineage(s)-specific modifications in gene expression/regulation among multiple species, by performing Phylogenetically-informed Profiling (PiP) of gene sets.
