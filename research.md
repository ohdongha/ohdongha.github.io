# Research

___
### Since 2022 May

- Comparative genomics to facilitate gene annotation

	- Fast and accurate protein-to-genome alignments to provide correct homology evidence 
  	- Reasonable and reliable Gene Ontology (GO) annotation to non-model organism genomes
	- Improving protein-coding gene models using sequence conservation in non-model organism genomes 
  
- Orthology inference and whole genome alignment (see more in [Random Questions](random.md))

	- Reporting orthologs and paralogs as part of eukaryotic genome annotation
	- Using orthologs for the curation of problematic gene models
	- Comparative genome browsers that are flexible and scalable
	- Ux and stories: what have been the most useful to users?

### Before 2022 May

- Developing tools to systematically detect lineage(s)-specific modifications in gene copy numbers and gene regulatory networks (GRNs), as a part of a [NSF-BSF-EDGE project](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1923589){:target="_blank"}
